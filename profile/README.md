## 🚀 Who We Are

**LongSwipe Ltd** is reimagining cross-border value transfer with stablecoins.  
We’re building a **voucher-based, chain-agnostic protocol** that enables frictionless remittance, gifting, and payouts—no wallet or gas fees required.

Our mission is simple: **make sending digital value as easy as sending a message**, for anyone, anywhere.

## 🛠️ What We Do

- 💸 **Voucher Protocol**  
  Create, share, and redeem stablecoin vouchers globally, without needing the recipient to hold a crypto wallet.

  Operates across **Ethereum, Solana, Base, Linea**, and other leading chains—removing the complexity of network fees and wallet setup.

- 🌍 **Built for Global Use**  
  From diaspora remittances to community aid and gifting, LongSwipe is designed for real-world adoption in emerging and connected markets.

- 🔐 **Compliance-Ready Infrastructure**  
  Optional KYC, transaction limits, and smart contract controls ensure security and regulatory alignment from day one.
